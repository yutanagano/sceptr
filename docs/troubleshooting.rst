Installing on Python :math:\geq 3.13 on Windows
-----------------------------------------------

User reports / CI testing have suggested that up to version ``1.1.1``,
installing SCEPTR on Python :math:\geq 3.13 on Windows results in an error.
This issue is fixed from version ``1.2.0`` onwards. If Windows users notice any
persisting problems despite using the latest version of SCEPTR, please submit
an issue on the `GitHub repository
<https://github.com/yutanagano/sceptr/issues>`_ to notify the maintainers.
